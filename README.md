Below are resources directly responsible for the success of this repository. 

The [OpenALPR](https://github.com/openalpr) library allows for the detection and recognition of number plates. Without this the training would have to be done yourself, using OpenCV, which this library builds on.

[AdaFruit](https://github.com/adafruit) for simplyfying LCD setup with the Adafruit library.
